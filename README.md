# IoF-sklad

A static prototype of an inventory (warehouse) management system with sample data and interfaces.

## Overview
The project demonstrates a mockup of warehouse workflows: stock management, product scanning, reports, and shipping details.  
It uses static HTML pages, CSV files, and SQL scripts as examples.

## Contents
- **HTML pages**: `index.html` (dashboard), `manage-stock.html`, `scan-products.html`, `view-reports.html`, `shipping-details.html`, `user-settings.html`, etc.  
- **CSV files**: `inventory.csv`, `users.csv` – sample datasets.  
- **SQL scripts**: `Products.sql`, `Lots.sql` – example schemas/data.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kirill-Klabukov/IoF-sklad.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start.  

3. Explore different pages to view mock functionality.  

4. CSV and SQL files can be used as sample data sources.  

## Next Steps
- Add backend/API and database integration.  
- Enable CRUD operations.  
- Make UI responsive and dynamic.  
- Add authentication for user settings.
